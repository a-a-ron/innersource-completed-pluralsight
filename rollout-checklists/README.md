Companies often kick off their InnerSource programs by starting small. Pilot projects can help teams experiment with more open processes, democratize access to code, and document best practices before applying InnerSource more widely.

Small successes can help show your internal community of developers how to make the most of their code and ship better software, faster.

## Consider measuring:

- % of issues created from external contributors
- Responsiveness (e.g. how quickly does someone respond to an issue opened by an external contributor)
- % of PRs that come from external contributors
- % of PRs from external teams that are merged
- % of reviews that come from external contributors
- % of code reuse across projects
- % of repositories using InnerSource components (managed contributing guidelines, assigned TCs, )

## Initial InnerSource rollout checklist

Here is a list of some recommended checklist items to review when adopting InnerSource that apply to most organizations:

- [ ] Define program goals, timeline and Exec sponsor team
- [ ] Identify pilot group(s) to validate and drive internal success
- [ ] Establish and schedule initial workshops to align purpose with practice among internal pilot group(s)
- [ ] Create internal portal for InnerSource
- [ ] Establish Search/Tagging conventions
- [ ] Establish template documentation and repository set up guidelines.
- [ ] Contributing guidelines, passive documentation, etc.
- [ ] Provide example workflows that teams can use to blueprint their desired workflow
- [ ] Provide a template repository with example README(s), issue and pull request templates, CONTRIBUTING files, license guidance, CODEOWNER templates, gitignore files, etc.
- [ ] Create an innersource team within the GitHub organization to provide guidance when at-mentioned

## Expanding your checklist

Many companies have already adopted InnerSource or are currently in the process. There is a lot of great information from many resources including InnerSource Commons and PayPal's journey just to name a few.
